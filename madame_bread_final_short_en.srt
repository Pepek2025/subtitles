1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,500
The bread that I bake and the bakery that I eat was created out of love for them, out of love for the children.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
I like this ritual. It sets me in the right direction during the day.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Everything is made by hand, by the baker on the table.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,000
I try to make the ingredients that we use in the bakery ecological, not taken from the other side of the world.

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,000
We share what is very important in the history of Poland, which is bread.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In the Polish family, among friends, where we celebrate, I can't imagine a table without bread.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We participate in this ritual of certain people in a given life.
